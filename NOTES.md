# Notes

## Description

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

```
arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
```

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

```
arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
```
